500px "Photo Frame" Groovlet
============================

This Groovlet was written in an effort for me to get some basic understanding of the [500px API](https://github.com/500px/legacy-api-documentation) and also gain familiarity with Groovlets.

This code will likely evolve and be used, in some form, in a Raspberry Pi photo frame that I plan on building.

The current webserver.groovy file is based heavily on one used in [Groovy in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/groovy-in-action-second-edition).
